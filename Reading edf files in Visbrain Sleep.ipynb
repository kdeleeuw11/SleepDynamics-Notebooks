    "# Issues with Visbrain Sleep\n",
    "Currently I have found three main issues with Visbrain Sleep when reading .edf files from Physionet:\n",
    "- Visbrain Sleep cannot handle multiple sampling frequencies. The Physionet files have two different sampling frequencies:\n",
    " - 100 Hz for EEG Fpz-Cz, EEG Ps_Oz, and EOG horizontal\n",
    " - 1 Hz for Rep oro-nasal, EMG submental, Temp rectal, and Event marker\n",
    "- above issue can be solved by using the MNE software to read the edf files. MNE can handle multiple sampling frequencies. However, there is an interface issue between MNE and Visbrain Sleep. When the values of a channel are recorded in $\\mu V$, MNE converts the values to $V$, while Visbrain Sleep does not convert these values. This issue is solved in Visbrain  in the the function `mne_switch` of the program `mneio.py` (for details, see below)\n",
    "- in the header of the edf files, the following is specified:\n",
    " - the number of data records (`n_records`)\n",
    " - record length in seconds (`record_length`)\n",
    " - sample frequency per data record or samples per record for each channel (`n_samples_per_record`)  \n",
    " \n",
    " for the Physionet Sleep files, the record length in seconds is typically 30. The sampling frequency per record is typically 3000 for the first three channels and 30 for the others. This means that the actual sampling frequency is 100 Hz and 1 Hz respectively. However, when determining the time axis in Visbrain Sleep, the sample frequency per data record (3000) is used, while the actual sample frequency of 100 Hz should be used. It looks like the program is only tested for situations where the number of data records per second is 1. This issue is fixed in the program `read_sleep.py` (for details see below)  \n",
    "- Visbrain Sleep has a very rudimentary module for reading hypnogram files and therefore cannot read the hypnogram files which are provided by Physionet. This means that the hypnogram files as provided by Physionet have to be converted to a form which is readable for Visbrain Sleep. This issue is dealt with in a separate notebook  "

    "# The fixes\n",
    "Two fixes are required to make the Visbrain Sleep software work correctly for the Physionet files:\n",
    "- the variable `sf` has to be set to the sampling frequency instead of the number of samples per data record\n",
    "- when using the MNE software to read the data files, the units of measurement for the channels measured in Volts has to be changed back from $V$ to $\\mu V$  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fix those two issues, the following has been done:\n",
    "- in the Visbrain program `io/read_sleep.py`, line 305 has been commented out and line 306 has been added:  \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "305    #freqs = np.unique(edf.hdr['n_samples_per_record'])\n",
    "306    freqs = np.unique(edf.hdr['n_samples_per_record'])/edf.hdr['record_length']\n",
    "307    sf = freqs.max()```\n",
    "This sets the variable `sf` to the sampling frequency in Hz and consequently, the time axis is computed correctly\n",
    "- in the Visbrain program `io/mneio.py`, line 68 had been added to convert the values of the channels back from $v$ to $\\mu V$:  \n",
