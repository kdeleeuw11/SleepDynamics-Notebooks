    "Visbrain Sleep provides the option to read hypnogram files in addition to polysomnography information. The information in the [Visbrain documentation](http://visbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sleep.html#supported-files-and-format) is pretty minimal. It includes a warning that there is no international standard for the hypnogram format. Visbrain Sleep supports three extensions for hypnogram files:\n",
    "- .txt\n",
    "- .csv\n",
    "- .hyp(ELAN)  \n",

    "The Physionet Sleep database contains hypnogram files. For each subject there are two files:\n",

    "- `\"subject identifier\"-Hypnogram.edf` file  \n",
    "\n",
    "The information in both files is basically the same, but differently formatted.  \n",

    "Note `.edf.hyp` is not the format supported by Visbrain.  \n",

    "# The Visbrain  .txt hypnogram file\n",
    "The way Visbrain Sleep handles a hypnogram .txt file is pretty primitive. It actually requires two files to specify the hypnogram. According to the Visbrain Sleep documentation this is to overcome problems caused by different sampling rate of hypnogram files and/or different values assigned to each sleep stages. The two files are:\n",
    "- `name.txt`  \n",
    "this file contains an integer value as the identifier of the sleep stage for each time period. The identifier as well as the time period are defined in the second file\n",
    "- `name_description.txt` file  \n",
    "this file defines the time period for scoring the sleep stages. Note that there is only one time period. Also the identifiers for the various sleep stages are defined here. The file is not defined as input, but is automatically read by the Visbrain program after deriving the file name from the file containing the sleep stages. The program takes the first part of the filename (`name`) and put `_description.txt` after the filename to construct the name of the file to read. This process results in `name_description.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no internal verification that the hypnogram files provide information for the same subject as the file for the channel information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above can be illustrated by the example from Visbrain:  \n",
    "- the `name.txt` file in this example is called `Hypnogram_excerpt2.txt`. The file has 362 lines:\n",
    " - the first line contains `[Hypnogram]`\n",
    " - the following lines all contain an integer between 0 and 5 identifying the sleep stage for that time period\n",
    "- the `name_description.txt` file in this example is called `Hypnogram_excerpt2_description.txt`. The file contains the following lines:\n",
    " - line 1: `time 2.5`\n",
    " - line 2: `W 5`\n",
    " - line 3: `N1 3`\n",
